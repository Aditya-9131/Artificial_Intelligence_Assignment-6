 Given_question:
-> Implement Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm
to solve any problem of your choice. Ensure that the implementation includes necessary
components such as initialization, selection, crossover, mutation forGA, and initialization,
movement, velocity update for PSO. Record and analyze the performance metrics such as
convergence rate, solution quality, and computational time.

# process:

To demonstrate the implementation of both a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we'll solve the same optimization problem using both methods. The problem we'll tackle is the minimization of the Rastrigin function, a common test function for optimization algorithms due to its complexity and large number of local minima.

The Rastrigin function is defined as:

f(x)=10n+∑

 [x

where 
𝑛
n is the number of dimensions (variables) and 
𝑥
x is a vector of 
𝑛
n real numbers.
