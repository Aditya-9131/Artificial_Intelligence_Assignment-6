# Artificial_Intelligence_Assignment-6
 Given_question:
-> Implement Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm
to solve any problem of your choice. Ensure that the implementation includes necessary
components such as initialization, selection, crossover, mutation forGA, and initialization,
movement, velocity update for PSO. Record and analyze the performance metrics such as
convergence rate, solution quality, and computational time.
